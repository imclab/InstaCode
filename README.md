An instant-setup Linux based coding environment for beginners on Windows.

### Setting up a development environment is very hard for beginners

Many programming tutorials assume the the reader:

- Has Linux or OSX
- Knows how to use the terminal
- Knows how to use a text editor

Whenever you exit the Silicon Valley/University/Starbucks bubble, you see that most people:

- Have Windows
- Have never touched a terminal
- Think Microsoft Word and TextEdit are text editors (to be fair, TextEdit has a confusing name)

According to [this Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems), Windows has over 90% market share. Since it is so hard to install modern development tools for Python, Ruby, and JavaScript on Windows, most people have a huge hurdle to overcome when they are trying to learn to code.

For absolute beginners, this can be pretty daunting and I'm sure many give up right away.  When I was first learning to code the hardest part (and the one that wasn't really covered anywhere) was setting up a development environment to get a `Hello world!`program running.

### Current Solutions

There are a few solutions to this problem available now, but they aren't optimal:
