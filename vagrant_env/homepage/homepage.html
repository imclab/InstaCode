        <h3>What is InstaCode?</h3>

        <p class="lead">InstaCode lets you effortlessly start coding real projects, 
          even if you have never heard of "Linux" or the "Terminal" before. It comes with:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>One step installer for Windows and Mac</li>
          <li>A code editor called <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a></li>
          <li>A <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Linux VM</a> so that you can enjoy the benefits of the terminal while programming in your native OS</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> integration for version control, code sharing, and downloading examples</li>
          <li>A menu with <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> commands so that you can make and launch a real website with a few clicks</li>
          <li>Pre-packaged installers for many other languages (coming soon)</li>
        </ol>

        <br />
        <h3>Why We Are Working On It</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          Programming for beginners comes with a steep learning curve. This is because: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Most online tutorials assume readers are already familiar with common Unix terminal commands. In reality, most beginners have never used the terminal before.</li>
          <li>There is a significant disconnect between beginner coding tutorials and real life problems. Someone could have been learning Java for years and yet struggle to apply their skills on useful projects.</li>
          <li>Setting up a programming environment is tedious and unintuitive. Downloading and installing all the necessary tools and software are  discouraging to beginners.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>At <a href="http://hackprinceton.com/">HackPrinceton 2014</a>, we started InstaCode to remove these barriers to entry, so that everyone, even those who has never written a line of code, can start programming useful applications within minutes.</p>
